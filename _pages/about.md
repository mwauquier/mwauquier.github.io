I'm a computational linguist, specialized in the use of distributional semantics for the quantitative investigation of semantic and morphological phenomena. As of now, semantic specificities in the context of affix rivalry is my main gateway, but my work is not limited to morphologically constructed words.

Current position
------

I am an Associate Professor of NLP at Sorbonne Nouvelle university and Lattice (UMR 8094, Sorbonne Nouvelle, Ecole Normale Supérieure) in Paris.

I previously was a post-doctoral fellow at the Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle (LLF) at the Université Paris Cité (France), as part of the [Demonext project](https://www.demonext.xyz/en/home/) (ANR-17-CE23-0005), which aims at constructing a French morphological database (MDB) that describes the derivational properties of words in a systematic manner. The objective of my post-doc is to provide a computational and quantitative exploitation of this resource. More specifically, I investigate two main cases of affix rivalry in French: feminine agentive suffixes *-euse* and *-rice*, and demonym-coining suffixes *-ais*, *-éen*, *-ien* and *-ois*.


Research thematics
------

My work focuses on the study of semantic phenomena based on computational and quantitative approaches, with a special attention on fine-grained description of linguistic features/properties.

My research mostly builds on (but is not limited to) the use of distributional semantics, to investigate both quantitatively and qualitatively the semantic specificities of morphologically constructed words.  

My first Master thesis, entitled "[Indices distributionnels pour la comparaison sémantique de dérivés morphologiques](http://dante.univ-tlse2.fr/1827/)" ( *distributional clues for the semantic comparison of morphological derivatives*), 
It was pursued with a second Master thesis, entitled [Explorations méthodologiques pour la caractérisation distributionnelle de dérivés morphologiques](http://dante.univ-tlse2.fr/4137/) ( *methodological investigation for the distributional characterization of morphological derivatives*)...

It led to a PhD thesis, entitled "Confrontation des procédés dérivationnels et des catégories sémantiques dans les modèles distributionnels" [^1]. Data and code produced during my thesis are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mwauquier/PhdData).
