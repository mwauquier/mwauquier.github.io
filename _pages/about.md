I'm a computational linguist, specialized in the use of distributional semantics for the quantitative investigation of semantic and morphological phenomena. As of now, semantic specificities in the context of affix rivalry is my main gateway, but my work is not limited to morphologically constructed words.

Current position
------

I am an Associate Professor of NLP at Sorbonne Nouvelle university and Lattice (UMR 8094, Sorbonne Nouvelle, Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure) in Paris.


Research thematics
------

My work focuses on the study of semantic phenomena based on computational and quantitative approaches, with a special attention on fine-grained description of linguistic features/properties.

My research mostly builds on (but is not limited to) the use of distributional semantics, to investigate both quantitatively and qualitatively the semantic specificities of morphologically constructed words. With respect to derivatives, I mainly focus on French agent nouns, action nouns, and demonyms. As far as non constructed words are concerned, I study underspecified nouns and Czech inflected nouns and adjectives.

My research involves various approaches, from NLP-based tools (DSMs, 
statistical modeling, classification and prediction tasks) to 
experimantal-based data. I empirically test linguistic hypotheses that 
rely on linguistic, sociological and even 
geographical considerations.
