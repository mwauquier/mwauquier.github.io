I'm a computational linguist, specialized in the use of distributional semantic for the quantitative investigation of semantic phenomena. As of now, semantic specificities in the context of affix rivalry is my main gateway, but my work is not limited to morphologically constructed words.

Current position
======

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at the Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle (LLF) at the Université Paris Cité (France), as part of the [Demonext project](https://www.demonext.xyz/en/home/) (ANR-17-CE23-0005) which aims at constructing a French morphological database (MDB) that describes the derivational properties of words in a systematic manner. The objective of my post-doc is to provide linguistic descriptions based on the computational and quantitative exploitation of this resource. More specifically, I investigate affix rivalry in French through two main studies:
* Feminine deverbal agent nouns in *-euse* and *-rice* (as in *sculpteuse* and *sculptrice* "female sculptor")
* Demonyms in *-ais*, *-éen*, *-ien* and *-ois*

Both studies differ with respect of the methodology and the theoretical questioning.


Research thematics
======
My work is dedicated to the study of semantic phenomena based on computational and quantitative approaches, with a special attention on a fine-grained description of linguistic features/properties.

My research mostly revolves around the use of distributional semantics

My first Master thesis, entitled [Indices distributionnels pour la comparaison sémantique de dérivés morphologiques](http://dante.univ-tlse2.fr/1827/) (translation), 
It was pursued with a second Master thesis, entitled [Explorations méthodologiques pour la caractérisation distributionnelle de dérivés morphologiques](http://dante.univ-tlse2.fr/4137/) (translation)...

It led to a PhD thesis, entitled Confrontation des procédés dérivationnels et des catégories sémantiques dans les modèles distributionnels (translation)[^1]. Data and code produced during my thesis are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mwauquier/PhdData).
