J’ai bénéficié dans le cadre de mon contrat doctoral de deux avenants d’enseignement m’ayant permis de donner l’équivalent de 64h TD par an, en 2018 et en 2019, au département de Sciences
du Langage (UFR LLCE) de l’université Toulouse Jean Jaurès. Je suis par ailleurs chargée d’enseignement vacataire au département Sciences du langage (Faculté des Humanités) de l’Univer-
sité de Lille depuis septembre 2021, pour un total de 120h.

* ***Inflectional Morphology***
	* Spring 2022 - 2nd year of Linguistics Bachelor's program
	* 100 students
	* *Description:* This course provides an in-depth presentation of inflectional morphology. Students are given the tools to identify and analyze the morphosyntactic features, and to comprehend the interactions at stake between morphophonological markings and syntacic constraints. Students are confronted thorough the exercices with various languages, including French, English, German, Latin, Swahili, Sanskrit, and even fictive languages such as Tolkien's Quenya. By the end of the course, students are expected to master the following notions.
	* *Notions:* morphosyntactic features and values, contextual and inherent flexion, agreement andgovernment, inflectional paradigms, defectiveness, overabundance, syncretism.
* Derivational Morphology
	* Fall 2021 - 1st year of Linguistics Bachelor's program
	* 80 students
	* Content: This course provides an introduction to morphology. By the end of the course, students are expected to master the following notions: word, token, lexeme, derivational morphology, inflectional morphology, simplex, constructed lexeme, lexeme construction rule
* Advanced Derivational Morphology
	* Fall 2021 - 3rd year of Linguistics Bachelor's program
	* 80 students
	* Content: This course builds on the 1st-year introductory course on Derivational Morphology, and aims at outlining a more complex description of derivational morphology. Students are confronted with the limits of the definitions they were presented during 1st year. By the end of the course, students are expected to master the following notions: non constructed complex word, derivational family, derivational paradigm, lexical series, back-formation, atested meaning, constructed meaning, potential word

	* 10 students
	* Content: Theoretical and practical introduction to Distributional Semantics applied to linguistic research. Both presentation of state of art studies, including mine, and practical initiation to the construction and manipulation of distributional models. Jupyter notebooks with Python implementation (gensim) to create and interrogate models. By the end of the course, students are expected to master the following notions and skills: Distributional Semantics, distributional hypothesis, vector space models, basic use of gensim, distributioanl similarity, distributional analogy, compute, import and export a model
