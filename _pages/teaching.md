* Programming and Project Management
    * Spring 2023 - 1st year of Master's program (PluriTAL)
    * 45 students
    * *Description:* Students are expected to lead proceed to an topic modelling analysis of a journalistic diachronic corpus, by implementing a full pipeline. They are introduced to project management and distributed version control system.
    * *Notions:* git, bash, Python, NLP processing, UDPipe, topic modelling

* IT and Language Industry
	* Spring 2023 - 2nd year of Linguistics Bachelor's program
	* 110 students
	* *Description:* Students are introduced to NLP and language technologies through a lecture course and lab classes. They are expected to constitute a corpus of media front pages and to analyse it, through the use of a text mining tool.
	* *Notions:* corpus, text mining, regular expressions, co-occurrences, relative frequency

* Corpus Linguistics
	* Fall 2022 - 3rd year of Linguistics Bachelor's program
	* 100 students
	* *Description:* Students are introduced to corpus linguistics, and to the semantic annotation task. They are confronted with ontological and thematic typologies, and to the INCEpTION platform. They are expected to create their own oral corpus, and to annotate it with respect to the ontological types and thematic roles of nouns.
	* *Notions:* ontological types, thematic roles, annotation, inter-rater reliability, INCEpTION

* Machine Creativity and Automatic text generation
	* Fall 2022 - 1st year of NLP Master's program (PluriTAL)
	* 30 students
	* *Description:* Students are introduced to the notion of machine creativity in the context of NLP tasks and applications, and more specifically to text generation. The task is approached in both a practical and theoretical way, with a focus on linguistic issues with respect to data and evaluation.
	* *Notions:* machine creativity, natural language generation

* Morphology
	* Fall 2022 - 2nd year of Linguistics Bachelor's program
	* 15 students
	* *Description:* This course aims at providing an overview of morphology in a typological approach. Based on various languages, students are introduced to the main concepts of morphology.
	* *Notions:* derivation, inflection, morpheme, lexeme, word form, morphosyntactic features, morphophonological processes

Université de Neuchâtel (Switzerland)

* Introduction to distributional semantics
	* Fall 2022 - PhD students
	* 10 students
	* *Description:* In this invited course, I provide a theoretical and practical introduction to the use of distributional semantics to work on semantic relationships in corpora.
	* *Notions:* distribution, context, embeddings, distributional semantic model, word2vec

Université de Lille (France)

* Inflectional Morphology
	* Spring 2022 - 2nd year of Linguistics Bachelor's program
	* 100 students
	* *Description:* This course provides an in-depth presentation of inflectional morphology. Students are given the tools to identify and analyze the morphosyntactic features, and to comprehend the interactions at stake between morphophonological markings and syntacic constraints. Students are confronted thorough the exercices with various languages, including French, English, German, Latin, Swahili, Sanskrit, and even fictive languages such as Tolkien's Quenya. By the end of the course, students are expected to master the following notions.
	* *Notions:* morphosyntactic features and values, contextual and inherent flexion, agreement andgovernment, inflectional paradigms, defectiveness, overabundance, syncretism.
* Derivational Morphology
	* Fall 2021 - 1st year of Linguistics Bachelor's program
	* 80 students
	* Content: This course provides an introduction to morphology. By the end of the course, students are expected to master the following notions: word, token, lexeme, derivational morphology, inflectional morphology, simplex, constructed lexeme, lexeme construction rule
* Advanced Derivational Morphology
	* Fall 2021 - 3rd year of Linguistics Bachelor's program
	* 80 students
	* Content: This course builds on the 1st-year introductory course on Derivational Morphology, and aims at outlining a more complex description of derivational morphology. Students are confronted with the limits of the definitions they were presented during 1st year. By the end of the course, students are expected to master the following notions: non constructed complex word, derivational family, derivational paradigm, lexical series, back-formation, atested meaning, constructed meaning, potential word

Université Paris Cité (France)

* Quantiative Morphology
	* Spring 2021 - Linguistics Master program
	* 10 students
	* Content: In this invited talk, I provide an insight on how to do quantitative study with respect to morphology. This course builds on a presentation of my studies on derivatives based on distributional semantics.
