Here is a brief description of the main funded and non-funded projects I've been or still am involved with. When available, a link to their official website and their related data repositories is provided.


Demonette
------

**Demonette** is a French morphological database developped during the **Demonext** project funded by the French ANR (ANR-17-CE23-0005). Descriptions and Data are available on the [Demonext website](https://www.demonext.xyz/).

I contributed to the Demonext project as a post-doctoral fellow at the Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle (LLF) at the Université Paris Cité (France). The objective of my post-doc was to provide a computational and quantitative exploitation of this resource. More specifically, I investigated two main cases of affix rivalry in French: feminine agentive suffixes *-euse* and *-rice*, and demonym-coining suffixes *-ais*, *-éen*, *-ien* and *-ois*. Demonym rivalry was investigated through the statistical modelling of the interaction of phonological, morphological and geographical features. The study of *-euse* and *-rice* rivalry was led based on semantic and morphological properties, and most specifically through the use of word embeddings both in a classification task and a qualitative analysis of the vector space.

Articles recounting each study are currently under review. Data specific to the *-euse* and *-rice* rivalry study are available below.

FNS
------

Involved in the data selection and the morphological annotation of French nominalisations in the context of the Swiss funded project ...

PhD Thesis
------

My thesis investigated the semantics of morphological derivatives in French. It provided insights both on the use of distributional semantics in a linguistic perspective, and on sematic specificities of known rival affixes, such as *-euse* and *-rice* for agent nouns, or *-age*, *-ion* and *-ment* for action nouns.

Non-funded collaborations
------

I've had international collaborations with Richard Hugyhe (Fribourg University) on French agent nouns, tackling the semantic et morphological delimitation of the lexical class of agent nouns, and the affix rivalry realized within this lexical class. That led to publications in *Morphology*, *Word Structure* and *Verbum*, which data are available below.
