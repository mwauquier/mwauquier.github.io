Main funded and non-funded projects I've been or still am involved with, and their related data.


Demonette
------

French morphological database, funded by the ANR. Descriptions and Data are available on the [Demonext website](https://www.demonext.xyz/).

I've been specially working on affix rivalry in the context of French demonyms.

I've also been working on the morphosemantic distinction between French *-euse* and *-rice* suffixes in the formation of feminine agent nouns.

FNS
------

Involved in the data selection and the morphological annotation of French nominalisations in the context of the Swiss funded project ...

PhD Thesis
------

My thesis investigated the semantics of morphological derivatives in French. It provided insights both on the use of distributional semantics in a linguistic perspective, and on sematic specificities of known rival affixes, such as *-euse* and *-rice* for agent nouns, or *-age*, *-ion* and *-ment* for action nouns.

Non-funded collaborations
------

I've had international collaborations with Richard Hugyhe (Fribourg University) on French agent nouns, tackling the semantic et morphological delimitation of the lexical class of agent nouns, and the affix rivalry realized within this lexical class. That led to publications in *Morphology*, *Word Structure* and *Verbum*, which data are available below.
